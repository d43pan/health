# Welcome to Health

This site is a collection of people, links, and content which I found incredibly helpful on my journey to my own health.  

Some stuff is based on hard science and links will be provided.  

Some stuff is based on wild ass guesses of what lies behind my absolute ignorance of a topic.  

My hope is that by sharing what I think I've learned others will find it helpful on their journey and that by sharing what I definitely don't know others will take the time to correct me because that's just the kind of people they are.
